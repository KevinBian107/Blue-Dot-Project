# Blue Dot Project (BDP)
Study into the connection between Locus Coeruleus (LC)'s role in the generation of pathological anxiety and rumination as well as teh effect it would cause on balancing between exploitation and exploration. To this end, we are creating a Locus Coeruleus rumination system in which we call it as the **B**lue **D**ot (LC in greek means little blue dot) **P**roject (BDP).

# Current Progessive
1. We have an pure-inference model currently, changing output based on inout, one thing we can do is to construct the matrix a bit differently.
2. Let's get some behavior data that we can fit to -> then fit the model with a loss -> then let's play around with the input and output.
